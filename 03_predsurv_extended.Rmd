## Goals
Assessing the performance of prediction models with a time-to-event outcome: guidance for validation and updating with a new prognostic factor. In this document, we assume that individual data of the development and validation set are both available.

In particular:   
1. To develop a risk prediction model with a time-to-event outcome;  
2. To assess the prediction performance of a model with a time-to-event outcome;  
3. To assess the potential clinical utility of a risk prediction model with time-to-event outcome.

The extended code basically evaluates the prediction performance at a fixed time horizon (e.g. 5 years) and also for the entire follow-up time.

We loaded the development (rdata) and the validation data (vdata) from .rds format.
The Rotterdam breast cancer data was used to predict the risk of recurrence or death using size, stage and tumor size as predictors. These three predictors were used in the Nottingham Prognostic Index, one of the most popular index to determine prognosis following surgery of breast cancer.  
The Germany Breast Cancer Study Group data was used as an external validation of the model developed in the Rotterdam breast cancer data. The prediction model will be then extended using the progesterone (PGR) marker measured at primary surgery.  
The improvement in prediction performance will be evaluated internally in the Rotterdam data (development data) and in German Breast Cancer Study data (validation data).

## Goal 1: develop a risk prediction model with a time-to-event outcome
Prediction models are useful to provide the estimated probability of a specific outcome using personal information.
In many studies, especially in medicine, the main outcome under assessment is the time to an event of interest defined generally as survival time. Prognostic models for survival end points, such as recurrence or progression of disease, need to account for drop out during follow-up. Patients who have not experienced the event of interest are censored observations. Cox regression analysis is the most popular statistical model to deal with such data in oncology and other medical research.  

### 1.1 Preliminary investigation: survival and censoring curves in the development and validation data
First, we draw the survival and the censoring curves of the development and validation data
```{r, surv, fig.align='center'}
# Development set
sfit1 <- survfit(Surv(ryear, status == 1) ~ 1, data = rdata) # survival
sfit2 <- survfit(Surv(ryear, status == 0) ~ 1, rdata) # censoring

par(xaxs = "i", yaxs = "i", las = 1)
plot(sfit1, conf.int = FALSE, lwd = 2, xlab = "Years", bty = "n")
lines(sfit2, conf.int = FALSE, col = 2, lwd = 2)
legend(11, .9, c("Death", "Censoring"), col = 1:2, lwd = 2, bty = "n")
title("Development set")


# Validation set
sfit3 <- survfit(Surv(ryear, status == 1) ~ 1, data = vdata) # survival
sfit4 <- survfit(Surv(ryear, status == 0) ~ 1, vdata) # censoring

par(xaxs = "i", yaxs = "i", las = 1)
plot(sfit3, conf.int = FALSE, lwd = 2, xlab = "Years", bty = "n", xlim = c(0, 8))
lines(sfit4, conf.int = FALSE, col = 2, lwd = 2)
legend("bottomleft", c("Death", "Censoring"), col = 1:2, lwd = 2, bty = "n")
title("Validation set")
```
A number of 2982 patients were included to develop the risk prediction model for survival with a median follow-up of 9 years.
The median survival in the development data was 8 years with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of 7 and 9 years.
The 5-year survival was 59% (95% CI: 58-61%). 
A number of 686 patients were selected to externally validate the risk prediction model.The median survival in the validation data was 4 years. The median survival was 5 years while the 5-year survival was 49% (95% CI: 45-54%).


### 1.2 Secondary investigation: check non-linearity of continuous predictors
The potential non-linear relation between continuous predictors (i.e. progesterone level) and the outcome should be investigated before developing a risk prediction model. Non-linearity of continuous predictors can be checked using splines.  
Physically, a spline is a flexible wood or metal strip, which is passed through a set of fixed points (knots) in order to approximate a curve. The most common computational approximation to this is a cubic smoothing spline which is cubic between the knot points, and constrained to be linear beyond the two end knots. 
For the restricted cubic spline using rms::rcs() R package::function(), the position of the knots are defined at 10<sup>th</sup>,50<sup>th</sup> and 90<sup>th</sup> quantile of the continuous predictor distribution. For more details see Frank Harrell's book 'Regression Model Strategies' on page 27 (second edition).  
The user can specify the positions of the knots instead of using the default calculation of the knots proposed in the book of Frank Harrell.
To deal with very large influential value, we winzorize progesterone level to the 90<sup>th</sup>  percentile.

```{r,ff, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
# Winzorise PGR to the 99th percentile to deal with very large influential values;
p99 <- quantile(rdata$pgr, probs = .99)
rdata$pgr2 <- pmin(rdata$pgr, p99)
vdata$pgr2 <- pmin(vdata$pgr, p99)

dd <- datadist(rdata)
options(datadist = "dd")
fit_pgr <- cph(Surv(ryear, status) ~ rcs(pgr2), data = rdata, x = T, y = T, surv = T)
plot(Predict(fit_pgr))
options(datadist = NULL)
```

We should model the progesterone level using a three-knot restricted cubic spline. We save the spline in the development and validation data.

```{r,rcs_save, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,fig.align='center'}
# Save in the date the restricted cubic spline term using rms::rcspline.eval() package
# Development set
rcs3_pgr <- rcspline.eval(rdata$pgr2, knots = c(0, 41, 486))
attr(rcs3_pgr, "dim") <- NULL
attr(rcs3_pgr, "knots") <- NULL
rdata$pgr3 <- rcs3_pgr
rm(rcs3_pgr)

# Validation set
rcs3_pgr <- rcspline.eval(vdata$pgr2, knots = c(0, 41, 486))
attr(rcs3_pgr, "dim") <- NULL
attr(rcs3_pgr, "knots") <- NULL
vdata$pgr3 <- rcs3_pgr
rm(rcs3_pgr)
```

### 1.3 Model development: first check - the proportional hazard (PH) assumption
We now examine the fits in a more careful way by checking the proportionality of the hazards of the Cox regression model.
Firstly, we fit the first prediction model in the development data using size, node, grade. Then, we check the PH assumption.

```{r,ph, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,fig.align='center'}
dd <- datadist(rdata)
options(datadist = "dd")
options(prType = "html")
fit1_cph <- cph(Surv(ryear, status) ~ csize + cnode + cgrade, rdata, x = T, y = T, surv = T)


zp1 <- cox.zph(fit1_cph, transform = "identity")
kable(round(zp1$table, 3)) %>% kable_styling("striped", position = "center")

oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2, 2), mar = c(5, 5, 1, 1))
for (i in 1:3) {
  plot(zp1[i], resid = F)
  abline(0, 0, lty = 3)
}
par(oldpar)
options(datadist = NULL)
```

The statistical tests show strong evidence of non-proportionality. Since the number of death is large the formal tests are quite sensitive, however, and it is important to also examine the graphs.  
These show an estimated coefficient as a function of time. As a further follow-up we will divide the data into 3 epochs of 0-5, 5-10, and 10+ years, fitting a separate model to each.

```{r, epoch,warning=FALSE}
# Development
edata <- survSplit(Surv(ryear, status) ~ .,
  data = rdata, cut = c(5, 10),
  episode = "epoch"
)
efit1 <- cph(Surv(ryear, status) ~ csize + cnode + cgrade,
  data = edata[edata$epoch == 1, ], x = T, y = T, surv = T
)
efit2 <- cph(Surv(ryear, status) ~ csize + cnode + cgrade,
  data = edata[edata$epoch == 2, ], x = T, y = T, surv = T
)
efit3 <- cph(Surv(ryear, status) ~ csize + cnode + cgrade,
  data = edata[edata$epoch == 3, ], x = T, y = T, surv = T
)
res_efit <- round(rbind(e1 = coef(efit1), e2 = coef(efit2), e3 = coef(efit3)), 2)
rownames(res_efit) <- c("Epoch 1: 0-5 years", "Epoch 2: 5-10 years", "Epoch 3: >10 years")
kable(res_efit) %>% kable_styling("striped", position = "center")

options(prType = "html")
tt1 <- table(edata$epoch, edata$status, dnn = c("Epoch", "Status"))
rownames(tt1) <- c("Epoch 1: 0-5 years", "Epoch 2: 5-10 years", "Epoch 3: >10 years")
kable(tt1,
  col.names = c("Censored", "Event"),
  row.names = TRUE
) %>% kable_styling("striped", position = "center")
```

A drastic change in the size coefficients across all epochs is apparent,
along with a major reduction in the nodes coefficient in epoch 3. As an ameleoration of this we will refit the model using only the first epoch, which includes most of the recurrences and deaths.  
We applied the administrative censoring at 5 years in the development data and we assessed the prediction performance of the prognostic model at 5 years. The 5-year horizon was chosen because it is also a common prediction time horizon in clinical practice.  The hazards in the development data seem not totally proportional within 5 years but minor deviation of proportionality were considered acceptable. 
In R the summary function creates a more detailed report of a fit.  
Possible alternatives to address the violation of proportional hazards are:

 + a stratified Cox proportional hazard models for the predictor(s) that  violates the proportional hazard. The offending predictor will be absorbed into the baseline (as a strata), and then use the full follow-up. 
 In this scenario, it seems that the size predictor violates the proportional hazard assumption. So, three baseline hazards will be non-parametrically estimated. For prediction, the absolute risks will be calculated considering the different baseline hazards. The hazard ratio for size will not be estimated since it is incorporated in the baseline;
 
+ fitting the model with interaction between the offending predictor (in this case size) and the logarithm of the time. This complicates the interpretability of the model and risk prediction might be not fully estimated for new patients at the time of breast cancer diagnosis since size interacts with the time which is unknown for new patients.

If we ignored the non-proportional hazards entirely, the prediction performance of the model may lead to increase bias in estimating the risk especially in terms of calibration performances.


### 1.4 Model development: fit the risk prediction models
We develop the risk prediction model in the development data considering the first 5-year follow-up to minimize the violation of proportional hazard including size, nodel and grade. The second model also includes the progesterone level modelled using a 3-knot restricted cubic spline.  
We also administratively censored the validation data at 5 years.


```{r, model_development, fig.align='center'}
# Consider the first 5-year epoch in the development set
edata1 <- edata[edata$epoch == 1, ]
# Refit the model
efit1 <- coxph(Surv(ryear, status) ~ csize + cnode + cgrade,
  data = edata1, x = T, y = T
)
# Additional marker
efit1b <- coxph(Surv(ryear, status) ~ csize + cnode + cgrade + pgr2 + pgr3,
  data = edata1, x = T, y = T
)


# Validation
evdata <- survSplit(Surv(ryear, status) ~ ., data = vdata, cut = 5, episode = "epoch")
evdata1 <- evdata[evdata$epoch == 1, ]
```


Below the results of the models:  

+ Classical model:  
```{r, summary_m1, fig.align='center',warning=FALSE}
dd <- datadist(edata1)
options(datadist = "dd")
options(prType = "html")
s5 <- cph(Surv(ryear, status) ~ csize + cnode + cgrade,
  data = edata1, x = T, y = T, surv = T
)
print(s5)
```

+ Extended model:  

```{r, summary_m2, fig.align='center',warning=FALSE}
options(prType = "html")
s6 <- cph(Surv(ryear, status) ~ csize + cnode + cgrade + rcs(pgr2, c(0, 41, 486)),
  data = edata1, x = T, y = T, surv = T
)
print(s6)
options(datadist = NULL)
```

The coefficients of the models indicated that higher size, higher number of positive lymph nodes and higher grade is more associate with poorer prognosis. The association of the progesterone biomarker and the outcome is non-linear as investigated previously.


## Goal 2: Assessing performance in survival prediction models
The performance of a risk prediction models may be evaluated through:  
  
  + discrimination:  the ability of the model to identify patients with and without the outcome and it requires the coefficients (or the log of the hazard ratios) of the developed risk prediction model to be evaluated.   

+ calibration: the agreement between observed and predicted probabilities. It requires the baseline (cumulative) hazard or survival.     
+ overall performance measures: as a combination of discrimination and calibration and/or as a measure of the explained variation;  

Unfortunately, a few publications report the complete baseline (cumulative) hazard or survival or even the baseline (cumulative) hazard or survival at fixed time horizon _t_.
If we had both individual data of the development and validation, a complete assessment of discrimination and calibration would be possible. We could evaluate the prediction performance of a risk prediction model at a fixed time horizon(s) _t_ and for the complete follow-up time.
In risk prediction, physicians typically focus on one or more clinically relevant time horizons to inform subjects about their risk. For this reasons, according to information available, different levels of validation assessment are possible.
Here we aim to assess the prediction performance of a risk prediction model with time-to-event outcome in case all individual data are available and in case of only the model equation of a fixed time horizon (i.e. at 5 years) is provided including the baseline survival.

### 2.1 Overall performance measures
Some overall performance measures are proposed using survival data:

+ R^2^: it quantifies the observed separation between subjects with low
    and high predicted risk;
    
+ Brier score: it is the squared differences between observed and predicted values at fixed time point (e.g. at 5 years);
  
+ Index of prediction accuracy (IPA): it improves interpretability by scaling the Brier Score.
  
  
First we save elements need to calculate the performance measures as the linear predictor and the predicted survival at 5 years in the development and validation data. Secondly, we create B bootstrap data to calculate percentile bootstrap confidence intervals needed for some performance measures.
```{r, bootstrap,warning=FALSE}

edata1$lp <- predict(efit1) # linear predictor
edata1$predsurv5 <- predictSurvProb(efit1, newdata = edata1, times = 5) # predicted survival
edata1$lp_1b <- predict(efit1b)
edata1$predsurv5_1b <- predictSurvProb(efit1b, newdata = edata1, times = 5)


evdata1$lp_1b <- predict(efit1b, newdata = evdata1)
evdata1$predsurv5 <- predictSurvProb(efit1, newdata = evdata1, times = 5)
evdata1$lp_1b <- predict(efit1b, newdata = evdata1)
evdata1$predsurv5_1b <- predictSurvProb(efit1b, newdata = evdata1, times = 5)

set.seed(20200416)
eboot <- bootstraps(edata1, times = 10)
vboot <- bootstraps(evdata1, times = 10)
# NOTE: B=10 otherwise the computation time will be too long
```

We calculate the overall performance measures: R<sup>2</sup>, Brier score, and IPA and the corresponding confidence intervals.

As expected the overall performance measures were lower in the external validation. Including information about PGR slightly improved the overall performance.

### 2.2 Discrimination measures
Discrimination is the ability to differentiate between subjects who have the outcome and subjects who do not.
In prognostic modelling, discrimination reflects separation between survival curves for individuals or groups.
The following discrimination measures are proposed:

+ Uno's C-index: evaluates discrimination ability for the entire follow-up time;  
+ Uno's time-dependent Area Under the ROC curve (AUC): evaluates discrimination at a fixed time horizon;  


Values close to 1 indicate good discrimination ability, while values close to 0.5 indicated poor discrimination ability.   

We used the time horizon at 4.95 and not 5 years since controls are considered patients at risk after the time horizon and we administratively censored at 5 years to minimize the violation of PH assumption (see paragraph 1.3).  

The Uno's C-index provides a measure of an overall discrimination over the follow-up time. The Uno's time-dependent AUC measures discrimination at a specific time horizon *t* defining cases and controls of censored data at a fixed time horizon *t*.
The Uno's C-index provided in the function subfolder (file UnoC.R) takes a lot of computational time. We suggested as fast alternative cindex() in the package pec. The cindex was proposed by Gerds and Wolbers: for details, see references below or using help(cindex). The code for Uno's C-index is present in the RMarkdown associated source code. 

More details are in the paper and in the references.

The time-dependent AUCs at 5 years were in the external validation were between 0.68 and 0.72 showing moderate discrimination. The additional information of the PGR marker increased the discrimination by 0.04.

The discrimination ability may be evaluated over the time since diagnosis through a plot showing the AUC over the time (years) in the development and validation set in the basic and extended model. Since the calculation of the AUC and the standard errors in the development set is computationally demanding, we showed only the plot in the validation data. However, we provided the R code (as a comment) for the development data.

The discrimination performance is higher in the extended model compared to the model without PGR over the entire follow-up.

### 2.3 Calibration
Calibration is the agreement between observed outcomes and predicted probabilities.
For example, in survival models, a predicted survival probability at a fixed time horizon _t_ of 80% is considered reliable if it can be expected that 80 out of 100 will survive among patients received a predicted survival probability of 80%.

Calibration is measured by:

+ Calibration in-the-large: lower or higher than zero indicates that prediction is systematically too high or low, respectively;
  
+ Calibration slope: below (above) 1.0 indicate over (under) estimation of risk by the model;
  
+ Calibration plot: it is a graphical representation of calibration in-the-large and calibration. It shows:
      
  + on the *x-axis* the predicted survival (or risk) probabilities at a fixed time horizon (e.g. at 5 years);
      
  + on the *y-axis* the observed survival (or risk) probabilities at a fixed time horizon (e.g. at 5 years);
      
  + The 45-degree line indicates the good overall calibration. 
      Points below the 45-degree line indicates that the model overestimate the observed risk. 
      If points are above the 45-degree line, the model underestimate the observed risk;
      The observed probabilities estimated by the Kaplan-Meier curves (in case of survival) or by the complementary of the Kaplan-Meier curves (in case of risk in absence of competing risks) are represented in terms of percentiles of the predicted survival (risk) probabilities.
      
+ Integrated Calibration Index (ICI): it is the weighted difference between smoothed observed proportions and predicted probabilities
in which observations are weighted by the empirical density function of the predicted probabilities;  

+ E50, E90 and Emax denote the median, the 90th percentile and the maximum absolute difference between observed and predicted probabilities of the outcome at time *t*;  

+ Kaplan-Meier curves may be used as calibration assessment when the baseline hazard function is not reported and a development paper reported only Kaplan-Meier curves for risk groups of the predictor index (PI). The PI is the combination of the coefficients estimated in the development data multiplied by the predictors in the validation data. Basically, if the survival curves for risk groups agree well visually between development and validation data, then good calibration may be implied. However, this is not strict comparison between observed and predicted values since a model-based approach was not used;  

When individual data information are both available for the development and the validation set, all calibration measures can be calculated and reported.  
When model equation of survival at a specific time horizon *t* is provided including the baseline hazard (or survival) and the coefficients,
calibration-in-the-large can be calculated as the ratio between the observed and the expected number of events at time *t* (known as OE ratio). Calibration slope, calibration plot, ICI, E50, E90 and Emax may be also calculated and reported.    
The calibration plot, ICI, E50, E90, Emax may be evaluated using different technique as restricted cubic splines or hazard regression. Here we show the calibration plots and the calibration measures using the restricted cubic splines technique. For hazard regression, please see the references at the end of the document.

#### 2.3.1 Calibration-in-the-large and calibration slope
Mean calibration (known also as calibration-in-the-large) requires the log of the baseline hazards to be calculated. However,
a Cox regression model does not allow its direct estimation because it does not provide a model intercept (i.e. the log baseline hazard).  
Recently, it was proposed to use a Poisson model for estimation of calibration-in-the-large  and calibration slope in the external dataset (Crowson et al, 2016). Briefly, a Cox model with pre-fixed baseline hazard is exactly equivalent to a Poisson regression. In addition, the likelihood of survival models is proportional to the likelihood of the Poisson models. More details are provided in the book 'Dynamic prediction in clinical survival analysis' (Hans van Houwelingen & Hein Putter, 2011), chapter 4 pages 57-69.  
We calculate the log of the cumulative hazard for each patient in the external dataset and enter this variable as an offset in a Poisson model (i.e. its coefficient = 1). The intercept of the model represents the calibration-in-the-large with an ideal value of 0.
In summary, calibration in-the-large indicates if prediction is systematically too high or low and calibration slope indicates (over/under)estimation of risk by the model;

Calibration in-the-large was 0.13 and 0.10  and calibration slope was 1.01 and 1.12 in the validation data without and with PGR, respectively.
The exponential of calibration in-the-large is known as the observed and expected ratio (OE ratio). When the ratio is above 1, the model underpredicts the risk and below 1 indicates the overprediction of the model. The OE ratio is 1.14 and 1.11.

#### 2.3.2 Calibration plot using restricted cubic splines
Calibration plots of the external validation data with and without PGR are calculated and shown using restricted cubic splines.  
The interpretation of the calibration plot were provided in the section 2.3 of this document, in the corresponding paper and in the literature provided in the paper and at the end of this document. More details about the method are given in the references below.

Both plots identified good calibration although probabilities of recurrence were slightly underestimated especially for the lowest and the highest values of 
the observed probabilities of recurrence.  
The additional information of PGR improved the overall calibration, especially for the highest values, as shown in the two calibration plots above.


#### 2.3.3 Other calibration metrics: ICI, E50,E90 and Emax based on restricted cubic splines
As explained in the previous sections, three additional calibration metrics were provided: the integrated Calibration Index (ICI), E50, E90 and Emax.  
ICI is the weighted difference between smoothed observed proportions and predicted probabilities in which observations are weighted by the empirical density function of the predicted probabilities.   
E50, E90 and Emax denote the median, the 90th percentile and the maximum absolute difference between observed and predicted probabilities of the outcome at time *t*.

In the validation data, PGR improves slightly the ICI and the median of the absolute difference between observed and predicted probabilities at 5 years.  More imprecise absolute differences between and observed and predicted probabilities in the extreme values of the distribution (E90, Emax). This is also graphically confirmed by the calibration plots.


## Goal 3: Clinical utility
Discrimination and calibration measures are essential to assess the prediction performance but insufficient to evaluate the potential clinical utility of a risk prediction model for decision making. When new markers are available, clinical utility assessment evaluates whether the extended model helps to improve decision making.  
Clinical utility is measured by the net benefit that includes the number of true positives and the number of false positives. For example, in time-to-event models, the true positives reflect the benefit of being event free for a given time horizon using additional interventions such as additional treatments, personalized follow-up or additional surgeries. The false positives represent the harms of unnecessary interventions.   
Generally, in medicine, clinicians accepts to treat a certain number of patients for which interventions are unnecessary to be event free for a given time horizon. So, false negatives (the harm of not being event free for a given time horizon) are more important than false positives (the harm of unnecessary interventions). Thus, net benefit is the number of true positives classifications minus the false positives classifications weighted by a factor related to the harm of not preventing the event versus unnecessary interventions. The weighting is derived from the threshold probability to death (one minus survival probability) using a defined time horizon (for example 5 years since diagnosis). For example, a threshold of 10% implies that additional interventions for 10 patients of whom one would have experience the event in 5 years if untreated is acceptable (thus treating 9 unnecessary patients). This strategy is compared with the strategies of treat all and treat none patients. If overtreatment is harmful, a higher threshold should be used.  
The net benefit is calculated as:  
  
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Chuge%7B%5Cfrac%7BTP%7D%7Bn%7D-%5Cfrac%7BFP%7D%7Bn%7D*%5Cfrac%7Bp_t%7D%7B1-p_t%7D%7D">
  
*TP*=true positive patients   
*FP*=false positive patients  
*n*=number of patients and *p*<sub>t</sub> is the risk threshold.  

For survival data *TP* and *FP* is calculated as follows:   
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5CLarge%7BTP%20%3D%20%5B1-S(t)%7C%20X%3D1%5D*P(X%3D1)*n%7D">
  
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5CLarge%7BFP%20%3D%20%5BS(t)%7C%20X%3D1%5D*P(X%3D1)*n%7D">
  
  where  
*S(t)* survival at time *t*  
  *X=1* where the predicted probability at time *t* is  *p*<sub>t</sub>  
  
  And the the decision curve is calculated as follows:
  
1. Choose a time horizon (in this case 5 years);
2. Specify a risk threshold which reflects the ratio between harms and benefit of an additional intervention;
3. Calculate the number of true positive and false positive given the threshold specified in (2);
4. Calculate the net benefit of the survival model;
5. Plot net benefit on the *y-axis* against the risk threshold on the *x-axis*;
6. Repeat steps 2-4 for each model consideration;
7. Repeat steps 2-4 for the strategy of assuming all patients are treated;
8. Draw a straight line parallel to the *x-axis* at y=0 representing the net benefit associated with the strategy of assuming that all patients are not treated.

Given some thresholds, the model/strategy with higher net benefit represents the one that potentially improves  clinical decision making. However, poor discrimination and calibration lead to lower net benefit.

Based on previous research we used a range of thresholds from 14% to 23% for adjuvant chemotherapy. If we choose a threshold of 20% the model had a net benefit of 0.262 in the development data using the basic model. This means that the model would identify 26 patients per 100 who will have recurrent breast cancer or die within 5 years since diagnosis and thus adjuvant chemotherapy is really needed.   
The decision curve shows that the net benefit would be much larger for higher threshold values, i.e., patients accepting higher risks of recurrence compared to the treat all strategy. The same interpretation may be used in the validation data:
  choosing a threshold of 20% the basic model had a net benefit of 0.385 for the basic and the extended model.  
Moreover, net benefit can be defined in terms of reduction of avoidable interventions (e.g adjuvant chemotherapy per 100 patients) by:
  
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Chuge%7B%5Cfrac%7BNB_%7Bmodel%7D%20-%20NB_%7Ball%7D%7D%7B(p_t%2F%20(1-p_t))%7D*100%7D%0A">  
  
  where *NB*<sub>model</sub> is the net benefit of the prediction model, *NB*<sub>all</sub> is the net benefit of the strategy treat all and $p_{t}$ is the risk threshold.
