# Assessing predicition performance of survival models
The following repository illustrates how to develop and validate a risk prediction models with survival outcome.
Different guidelines are available according to the different level of statistical education, experience and interests of the user according to the [STRATOS](https://www.stratos-initiative.org/) initiative.

The collaboration with STRATOS topic [groups](https://www.stratos-initiative.org/groups) 6 and 8 was essential to provide this work.

The repository (will) contain the following code:  

+ [01_predsurv_simplified](https://github.com/danielegiardiello/Prediction_performance_survival/blob/main/01_predsurv_simplified.md). It illustrates how to develop and validate a risk prediction model with survival outcomes when both development and validation data are available for users with low statistical knowledge;  

+ 02_presurv illustrates how to validate a risk prediction model with survival outcomes when model equation of a developed risk prediction model is available and validation data are available (work in progress, not available yet);  

+ 03_predsurv_extended a more extensive illustration of 01_predsurv_simplified for users with more advanced statistical knowledge (work in progress);

Dat, external functions and figures are available in the corresponding subfolder.
A general SAS code will be also available.
